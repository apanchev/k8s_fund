# Project description

Everything i'm working on for my linuxfondation KUBERNETES FUNDAMENTALS (LFS258) course.

I'm using terraform and Ansible to automate my AWS EC2 configurations.

# Start the project

Almost automated everything to go faster, just launch the script.

```bash
./linuxfondation.sh
```
